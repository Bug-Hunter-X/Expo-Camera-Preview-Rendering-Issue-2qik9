This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The issue is that when the camera is initially rendered, it fails to display the preview, resulting in a blank screen.  However, after navigating away from the screen and returning, the camera preview renders correctly. This behavior is inconsistent and only occurs in certain situations, making debugging challenging. The problem is not related to permissions, as they are granted correctly.  Furthermore, the issue is not reproduced consistently across different devices and Expo SDK versions. 

```javascript
// buggy component
const CameraComponent = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; //While asking for permission
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Other camera components */}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};
```
